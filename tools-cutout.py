"""Cut the bottle out of a studio photograph for the product page.

The page behind the bottle is the same near-black the catalogue card uses,
which changes what the matte has to be. Compositing over black gives
result = source x alpha, so any pixel below full opacity comes out darker
than the photograph — a soft ramp was quietly dimming the glass and the
label. Full opacity for anything with light in it reproduces the original
exactly, and the only thing keyed out is the true black backdrop, which the
page supplies itself.

The crop is fixed rather than detected. Every automatic bound tried here was
fooled by something: brightness finds the lit marble floor, which on the
red-wine bottles is brighter than the bottle; column mass finds the label
specular; column height finds the studio halo, which is as tall as the
bottle. Measured across all five photographs the setup is consistent to
within a couple of percent (centre 49.0-50.5%, subject width 24.6-32.5%,
top 4-7%), so a fixed window with margin is simpler and more predictable —
and a differently shot photograph will look wrong immediately, not subtly.
